# 2017_alpha_synch_visual_attention

This repository contains R code relating to the "High-alpha band synchronization across frontal, parietal and visual cortex mediates behavioral and neuronal effects of visuospatial attention" manuscript.

Two types of files are provided: 
* The .md files contain the code that was run as well as the plots and the results of the analysis.
* The .Rmd files are R notebooks that will allow anyone to rerun the analysis once the data is made available (once the manuscript is accepted for publication). Please get in touch with me if you would like to get the data before it becomes freely available.



The scripts correspond to the analysis and plots of the following figures:
* Figure 1
  * [Behavioral data analysis](behavioral_analysis.md)
* Figure 5
  * [Lateralization of high-alpha synchrony](lateralization_of_alpha_synch.md)
  * [lateralization of low-alpha amplitudes](lateralization_of_amplitude_suppression_visual_cortex.md)
* Figure 6
  * [Lateralization of visual system connectivity](lateralization_of_visual_connectivity.md)
* Figure 7
  * coming soon
* Figure 8
  * coming soon


Before running anty of the R notebooks, please change the working directory to the root directory of the file before running the script. This ensures the different file paths are correctly encoded using the package here.
